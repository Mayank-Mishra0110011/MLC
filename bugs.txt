if both cont and brk are in loop, it seg faults or pushes wrong values on stack causing a 
runtime error depending on the order of cont, brk

cont does not work in while

if switch is inside loop, brk breaks from loop

in switch if none of the cases match it should jump into the def case however, for now if
no cases match AND a def case exists, the program seg faults.
